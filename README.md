Sistema della Sicurezza 6.0.0.0

Sistema della Sicurezza has already been installed in some important Italian companies to support the management process of compliance foreseen by the European Directives (implemented in Italy by the Decree 81/2008, and subsequent adjustments) on the subject of safety at work.

It allows monitoring of all fundamental elements for correct and complete management of the Decree 81/2008 requirements (i.e. Working activity, Connected risks, Medical and Sanitary Surveillance, Staff training, Activity Planning and Register, Individual Protection Device, etc., etc.).

All logical connections present in the above-mentioned example list are managed by means of the creation of a data base which is continuously fortified accordingly with all the elements of variation which occur during a working day.

Such information also includes the Risk Assessment Document which is regularly updated and available for any necessary monitoring both internal and external (Inspections).

There are no specific creation restrictions among the entities involved; the company can decide autonomously how much detail it wishes to define when using the system.

The Safety System has been developed along the lines of a multi-company logic, which permits the use of a sole licence for all the companies belonging to the same group. These are able to be totally autonomous or coordinated, with a view to improve and standardize the working activity, a task for  a Central Safety Office.

Furthermore, the defined applicative structure permits a rapid conversion of the System in other languages
